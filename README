# Text-Based Adventure Game

This project implements a text-based adventure game in Python. The game is structured using object-oriented principles and offers an interactive, expandable gameplay experience.

## Code Structure

The game is organized into several classes:
- `GameState`
- `QuestSystem`
- `LocationSystem`
- `GameEngine`

This structure demonstrates good object-oriented design and allows for easy management of different game aspects.

## Key Features

1. **Location System**: Multiple interconnected areas for exploration.
2. **Quest System**: Players can take on and complete various quests.
3. **Mini-Games**: Includes interactive elements like "guess the number" and "rock-paper-scissors".
4. **Player State**: Tracks health and inventory throughout the game.
5. **Text-Based UI**: Simple and clear interface with descriptive options.
6. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new locations, quests, and encounters.

## Code Quality

- Well-commented
- Follows Python naming conventions
- Effective main game loop managing overall flow

## Potential Improvements

1. Enhance error handling in certain areas
2. Further modularize some methods (e.g., `encounter_by_location`)
3. Implement a save/load feature for longer gameplay sessions

## Conclusion

This project provides a solid foundation for a text-based adventure game, with ample room for expansion and refinement.
